Tutorial
========

Read this to get started quickly.

The tutorial will assume that you know your Python, and have some idea about
how computer graphics work – if you aren't familiar with coordinate systems,
you should read a different text.

Gillcup Graphics tries to not hide anything from you, but to make your work
easier by providing a higher-level graphics layer atop Pyglet.
To do non-trivial things (such as advanced transformations, fast batches,
shaders, video), or things that are out of scope for a this library
(e.g. sound), you should learn something about the underlying concepts.
Gillcup Graphics mixes with Pyglet or “raw” OpenGL calls easily.
