Gillcup Graphics documentation
==============================

Gillcup Graphics is a Pyglet-based graphics library that allows you to craft
scenes out of trees of objects such as layers and sprites.
It uses Gillcup animated properties to allow dynamic changes to scene trees,
allowing complex animations or games.

.. note::
    Gillcup Graphics is currently primarily an excersise in building a robust
    API and showcasing Gillcup's capabilities. As with early Python, the
    focus is now on a straightforward interface and implementation, rather
    than speed.
