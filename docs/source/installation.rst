Installation and Dependencies
=============================

The short story: ``pip install gillcup_graphics``

----

You need to have Python and OpenGL on your computer to run Gillcup Graphics.

Besides that, Gillcup Graphics depends on two Python libraries:
`Gillcup`_ and `Pyglet`_. These are pulled in automatically when you install
via `pip`_ or a similar tool.

.. _Gillcup: http://gillcup.readthedocs.org
.. _Pyglet: http://www.pyglet.org/
.. _pip: http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/index.html

If you have no clue what that meant, please go read its `instructions`_, and
substitute ``gillcup_graphics`` for the package you would like to install.

If you have an aversion to pip for some reason, use any other tool that can
install from PyPI.
