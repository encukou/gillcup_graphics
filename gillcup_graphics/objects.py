"""Drawable objects

This module provides basic objects you can draw and animate.

Perhaps the most important of these is the :class:`Layer`, which does not have
a graphical representation by itself, but can contain other objects, such as a
:class:`~gillcup_graphics.Rectangle`, :class:`~gillcup_graphics.Sprite` or
another :class:`~gillcup_graphics.Layer`.
Graphics objects are thus arranged in a scene tree.
The tree is rooted at a parent-less Layer [#f1]_, which will usually be shown
in a :class:`~gillcup_graphics.Window`.

Each object has a lot of AnimatedProperties that control its position on the
screen (relative to its parent), and properties like color and opacity.

The objects are compatible with 3D transformations, but anything outside the
`z=0` plane needs custom OpenGL camera setup.
Refer to Pyglet documentation for details.

.. [#f1] To be precise, the root may be any object. It's just that non-Layers
    aren't terribly useful here.
